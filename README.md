# twit-sort
web-app that sorts twitter based on hashtags, users, lists, regex into mark-as-read streams

You can visit the running app at:  https://twit-sort.azurewebsites.net/ 

I have removed all the passwords etc, and checked it in as a public repo. 
I don't intend to continue development on it other than little features that i might want. 
I want to rewrite it using javascript-only, no server side component
And I also want to adapt it for use with facebook. 
When I get time :) 

Hope this helps you if you're looking for some examples of something.
